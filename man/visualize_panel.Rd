\title{Visualize a panel}
\usage{
visualize_panel(data, id = id, time = time, treatment = treatment, prepped = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class data.frame or tibble containing the panel data}

\item{id}{A column name containing the unique identifier of the observational unit in the panel (the i dimension)}

\item{time}{A column name containing the time variable in the panel (i.e. the t dimension)}

\item{treatment}{A column name containing the name of the dummy variable indicating whether unit i is treated at time t}

\item{prepped}{A boolean specifying if the panel has already been prepared through this package (i.e. the treatment_ids have been created and modified). If so, the points will be colored based on treatment id.}
}
\value{
a ggplot object
