\usage{
compute_cumulative_effects(
  model,
  prefix = "relative_time::",
  start = 0,
  level = 0.95,
  which = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A \code{fixest} or \code{conleyreg} object.}

\item{prefix}{Character prefix identifying the event-study coefficients. The
default matches \code{i(relative_time, ...)} produced names such as
\code{"relative_time::0"}.}

\item{start}{Integer relative time at which cumulative sums begin. Values
less than \code{start} are excluded before summing. If \code{i(relative_time, -1)}
was used, then we suggest you use -1 as an input here.}

\item{level}{Confidence level (default 0.95).}

\item{which}{If \code{model} is \code{fixest_multi}, selects the component to use.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{relative_time}, \code{cum_effect}, \code{std_error},
\code{conf_low}, and \code{conf_high}.

\description{
Compute cumulative event-study effects with delta-method standard errors.
}
\details{
The function forms cumulative effects by left-multiplying the vector
of event-time estimates with a lower-triangular matrix of ones. Let \code{β} be
the vector of selected event-study coefficients and \code{Σ} their covariance
matrix. The cumulative effect at horizon \code{h} is \verb{c_h = L_h β}, where \code{L_h}
sums coefficients up through \code{h}. The associated variance is
\verb{Var(c_h) = L_h Σ L_h'}, which is implemented via matrix multiplication. The
reported standard errors are the square roots of these variances (delta
method), and confidence intervals use the normal critical value.
