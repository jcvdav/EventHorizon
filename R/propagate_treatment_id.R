#' Assign id to leads and lags.
#'
#' @description
#' Propagates the treatment id from `treatment_ids` across control periods
#'
#'
#' @param id A column name containing the unique identifier of the observational unit in the panel (the i dimension)
#' @param time A column name containing the time variable in the panel (i.e. the t dimension)
#' @param treatment_id A character specifying the treatment id, as produced by `treatment_ids()`
#' @param window A number indicating the number of periods within which two or more treatment events are merged. This should be in the same units as `time`
#'
#' @returns A character vector specifiying the treatment id for treated and control periods of a given unit
